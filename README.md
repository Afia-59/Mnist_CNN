# Mnist_CNN
The code provided in this repository uses TensorFlow and Keras to build, train, and evaluate a CNN model on the MNIST dataset. The model architecture includes two convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, a dropout layer for regularization, and a dense output layer with softmax activation for classification.
