# MNIST Dataset Classification with CNN
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The goal is to classify these images into their respective digit categories.

# Overview
The code provided in this repository uses TensorFlow and Keras to build, train, and evaluate a CNN model on the MNIST dataset. The model architecture includes two convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, a dropout layer for regularization, and a dense output layer with softmax activation for classification.

# Requirements
To run this code, you need the following Python libraries:

• numpy
• tensorflow
• matplotlib

Install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy tensorflow matplotlib
```

# Installations

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Afia-59/Mnist_CNN.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Mnist_CNN
```

# Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the code.

Run the code cells or script to:

 1. Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.

 2. Build and compile the CNN model.

 3. Train the model on the training data.

 4. Evaluate the model on the test data.

 5. Visualize a sample image from the test set along with its predicted label.
